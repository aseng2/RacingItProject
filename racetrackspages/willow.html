            <p class = "p-content-2">Willow Springs International Raceway is a super-fast 2.5-mile / nine-turn road racing circuit, patterned after the great courses and road racing traditions of Europe, and is unchanged from its original 1953 configuration. With its substantial elevation changes and high average speeds, Willow Springs is one of the fastest and most challenging tracks in the country. Also known as the Fastest Road in the West, this track is one of the safest road courses in the world, despite its high velocities. Cornering speeds on this track range from about 70 mph to over 170 mph, with straightaway speeds nearing 200 mph possible with fastest cars and motorcycles. It has a 600-acre complex of eight racetracks embracing nearly every conceivable motor sports discipline. The park is located about an hour north of Los Angeles, California near Lancaster.</p>
            <p class = "p-content-2">With its long and short straight-aways, tight corners, and long sweeping turns, there arenâ€™t many road courses in the world with spectator viewing like Willow Springs. Guests can see almost the entire racecourse from just about anywhere, including the many trackside camping areas. Spectator amenities include two full-service diners with full bars, a well-stocked gift shop, plenty of spectators seating and parking modern rest rooms, and outstanding viewing areas. Large viewing areas are available for RV parking and camping, including several full hookups for trailers and motor homes. Racer amenities include several enclosed garages available for use by competitors and testers, with racing fuel and tire services available at the track daily.</p>
